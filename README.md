In this assignment we perform an analysis of Taxis in NYC. In particular, we are curious to answer to some specific research questions (RQs) that may help Taxi drivers in planning their movements throughout the city and the Taxi's users to have hints about the convenience of enjoying this service.

For this purpose we use the open data of Taxi's trips in NYC. In order to answer to the RQs we take into account the data related to Yellow cab for the year 2018.

[RQ1] In what period of the year Taxis are used more?

[RQ2] What are the time slots with more passengers?

[RQ3] Do the all trips last the same?

[RQ4] What is the most common way of payments?

[RQ5] Does a long distance correlate with the duration of the trip on average?

[CRQ1]: Does the fare for mile change across NY's borough? We want to discover whether the expenses of a user that enjoys Taxis in one zone is different from those that uses it in another one.

[CRQ2]: Visualize Taxis movements!
